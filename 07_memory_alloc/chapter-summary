Chapter Summary
---------------
Using the malloc family of functions, a process can dynamically allocate and release memory on the heap. In considering the implementation of these functions, we saw that various things can go wrong in a program that mishandles the blocks of allocated memory, and we noted that a number of debugging tools are available to help locate the source of such errors.
The alloca() function allocates memory on the stack. This memory is automatically deallocated when the function that calls alloca() returns.
